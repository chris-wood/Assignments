%Thesis:  \\
%1. benefit: nondeterminism joined with functional evaluation is extremely powerful
% the example with regular expressions is very helpful, and a common problem that programmers face
%2. benefit: search strategies for solving nondeterminism in equations increase declarative nature of programs
% rely on rules of the program to determine functional evaluation with decision trees, not case expressions hand-coded by the programmer
%3. benefit: can utilize either paradigm simply by omitting the other (don't include free variables in equations and logic programming aspect goes away)
%4. bad: search strategies aren't able to keep up with modern parallelism (functional languages don't have this issue because they are deterministic)
%	research is being done to make up for this...
