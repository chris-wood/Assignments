\cawtitlelong{4040-849 Optimization Methods}{Optimizing Cryptographic Strength of Substitution}{Layers in Symmetric-Key Cryptographic Algorithms}

\begin{abstract}
The cryptographic security of symmetric-key encryption algorithms is commonly based Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion \cite{Kim90astudy}. Confusion can be defined as the statistical relationship between the ciphertext and private key of a cipher, while diffusion refers to the statistical redundancy of plaintext bits in the ciphertext bits. Consequently, it is increasingly important to optimize these characteristics in order to make them less susceptible to common attacks, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. S(ubstitution)-boxes are the most traditional mathematical structures that are used to improve the levels of diffusion and confusion within symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms. Recent research efforts have revealed practical measurements of S-box constructions that indicate their susceptibility to linear and differential cryptanalysis \cite{Kim90astudy}. In this work, we discuss the formulation of building cryptographically strong substitution layers in symmetric-key block algorithms with S-box designs into a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that can be optimized to yield the high diffusion and confusion dividends in resulting algorithm definitions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem Description}
The cryptographic security of symmetric-key encryption algorithms is based upon Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion \cite{Kim90astudy}. Confusion can be defined as the complexity of the relationship between the secret-key and ciphertext, and diffusion is commonly referred to as the degree to which the influence of a single input plaintext bit is spread throughout the resulting ciphertext. When designing new cryptographic algorithms, it is increasingly important to optimize these characteristics in order to make them less susceptible to common attacks, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis.

Linear cryptanalysis is a popular attack technique that attempts to approximate the secret key used within a symmetric-key encryption algorithm using a set of known plaintexts. Mathematically, it is defined as the formulation of a linear expression that is composed of the input and output bits for a function within the algorithm (or the entire algorithm itself) that is satisfied with high probability (which is an indication of bit patterns generated by the target function). This expression is then cross-checked with a large set of known plaintexts in order to deduce the secret encryption key \cite{Heys01atutorial}.

Differential cryptanalysis is another powerful attack technique that attempts to break symmetric key ciphers by exploiting high probability of certain occurrences of plaintext differences and ciphertext differences \cite{Heys01atutorial}. By increasing the level of nonlinearity of a cipher, the probability of the occurrences of these differences decreases significantly, thus thwarting attacks that use this information to uncover the secret encryption key. 

Collectively, linear and differential cryptanalysis lose their effectiveness as the levels of confusion and diffusion within a symmetric-key encryption algorithm are increased. Therefore, it is a fundamental design goal of such algorithms to incorporate mathematical elements that exhibit high measures of confusion and diffusion when composed together. Combinations of linear and nonlinear operations are the most common means by which these characteristics are realized in symmetric-key encryption algorithms, with the S(ubstitution)-box being the most popular nonlinear component available to cryptographic designers. An S-box is a well-defined function that maps elements in the domain $\field{F}_2^n$ to elements in the range $\field{F}_2^n$. With this notion, we consider a configuration of an S-box to be a set of input and output pairs. Furthermore, we denote the canonical form of an S-box configuration as an integer sequence of length $2^n$ ordered by the input elements that contains the output elements in $\field{F}_2^n$.

The mathematical design and cryptographic strength of S-boxes, which are commonly referred to as the substitution layers within symmetric-key encryption algorithms, has been the focus of extensive research in recent years (CITE). However, there is a lack of work in the literature that formulates the problem of S-box construction as a constrained optimization problem. Therefore, we address this lack of focus and attempt to state the S-box construction problem as a set of mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with individual and multiple objective functions that can be solved to yield the optimum S-box configuration. The rest of this report is dedicated to the discussion of this effort.

\subsection{Cryptographic Strength of Substitution Layers}
Mathematically, an S-box can be represented as a function $f$ that maps input values $a \in \field{F}_2^n$ to output values $b \in \field{F}_2^n$. In the context of symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms, such a function $f$ should ideally be bijective in order to avoid bias towards any specific output element in the field. 

We now present a series of definitions that are pertinent to the design of cryptographically strong S-Boxes \cite{Mar_newanalysis}.

%TODO: http://www.waset.org/journals/waset/v48/v48-24.pdf && thesis work

\begin{define}
The \emph{Hamming weight} of an element $x \in \field{F}_2^n$ is defined as wt$(x) = \sum x_i$, where $x_i$ refers to the $i$th bit in $x$.
\end{define}

\begin{define}
The \emph{branch number} of an $n \times n$-bit S-Box $S$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
B_N = \text{min}_{a, b\not=a}\left[\text{wt}(a \oplus b) + \text{wt}(S(a) \oplus S(b))\right],
\end{eqnarray}
where $a, b \in \field{F}_2^n$ (CITE).
\end{define}

\begin{define}
A function $f : \field{F}_2^n \to \field{F}_2^n$ exhibits the \emph{avalanche effect} if and only if 
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{x \in \field{F}_2^n} \text{wt}(f(x) \oplus f(x \oplus c_{i}^{n})) = n2^{n-1},
\end{eqnarray}
for all $i$ $(1 \leq i \leq n)$, where $c_{i}^{n} = \langle 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0 \rangle$ (where a $1$ is in the $n$th position of the vector of cardinality $n$) (CITE).
\end{define}

\begin{define}
The \emph{avalanche number} of a function $f : \field{F}_2^n \to \field{F}_2^n$ is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
A_N = \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\sum_{x \in \field{F}_2^n} \text{wt}(f(x) \oplus f(x \oplus 2^{i})),
\end{eqnarray}
where $a, b \in \field{F}_2^n$. This just sums of the weight for each bit $i$, where $1 \leq 1 \leq n$.
\end{define}

\begin{define}
The \emph{degree of nonlinearity} of an $n \times n$-bit S-Box from $\field{F}_2^n \to \field{F}_2^n$ can be measured by
\begin{eqnarray}
	P_S = \text{max}_{0 \not= a, b}|\{x \in \field{F}_2^n : S(x + a) - S(x) = b\}|
\end{eqnarray}
where $a, b \in \field{F}_2^n$, and a low measure for $P_S$ indicates a high degree of nonlinearity (CITE).
\end{define}

Cryptographers and mathematicians commonly use these measurements as a basis for the levels of confusion and diffusion within a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, which in turns correlates to an approximation of their susceptibility to linear and differential cryptanalysis (among other attacks). In particular, it has been shown that cryptographically secure symmetric-key algorithms utilize substitution layers that provide the following characteristics \cite{Kim90astudy}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item High branch number
	\item Avalanche number of exactly $n^22^{n-1}$
	\item High degree of nonlinearity
\end{enumerate}
%However, in practice the additional constraints that fast and simple mathematical operations must be used %to emulate represent such a bijective function $f$ that exhibits ideal values for all of these measurements.

The best way to find optimal S-box configurations is to perform an exhaustive search over the permutation design space (i.e. consider all configurations) and find one that yields the optimum results. The results from an exhaustive search experiment for a $2$-bit S-box are shown in Figure \ref{bfjoint}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{images/brute_joint.eps} \\
	\label{bfjoint}
	\caption{The results for the branch number, avalanche number, and degree of nonlinearity for a $2$-bit S-box over all possible permutations in the design variables. Note that there are $4^4 = 256$ possible permutations over the S-box configuration design space because each element $x \in \field{F}_2^2$ can map to any output value $y \in \field{F}_2^2$.}
\end{figure}
Exhaustive searches over the entire S-box permutation design space have a time complexity of $O(n^n)$ and thus are only feasible for very small order S-boxes. However, recent research efforts have advanced the upper bound on these exhaustive searches to include $4$-bit S-boxes, which were run in \cite{Sbox4x4}. Unfortunately, measurements for the branch number, avalanche number, and nonlinearity degree were not provided. 

As an alternative to performing these brute force searches, we consider the problem of optimizing the branch number, avalanche number, and degree of nonlinearity of symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm as MINLP problems, which can be formulated as shown in Figure \ref{problems}.

\section{Candidate Optimization Algorithms}
%1. GA description - TODO: write up some characteristics of this algorithm
%2. BB description - TODO: write up some characteristics of this algorithm

Analyzing the function values for the branch number, avalanche number, and degree of nonlinearity over the S-box permutation design space indicates that each function is highly unstable and discontinuous. Therefore, traditional optimization methods that rely on the continuity of the functions are likely to not be very effective when solving these optimization problems. In fact, the application of the famous Branch and Bound algorithm was applied to solve these problems and yielded very poor results. For that reason, we turn our focus to more evolutionary algorithms that have a probabilistic or random element to them as they explore the domain of the design variable space. 

\subsection{Traditional Optimization Algorithms}
%4. discuss why BB algorithm didn't work (converged too early and didn't exhaust, too many local minimums for every objective function, GA was good because it generated populations and did psuedo brute force thing)

The \emph{Branch and Bound} algorithm is a very common optimization algorithm that is used to solve MINLP problems. However, this algorithm is not suitable in the context of this problem for a variety of reasons, as shown below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The branch and bound algorithm is greedy, in that it selects the appropriate decision branch to take to proceed towards the optimal value based on the current configuration. While this leads the algorithm towards an optimum value, it is usally a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, there is no penalty applied to the decision process that enables the design variables to change. 
	\item As shown in Figure \ref{bfjoint}, there are many locally optimum values for each objective function even with small order S-boxes. The usefulness of the BNB algorithm will surely degrade as larger order S-boxes are considered, because the number of intermediate local optimum values will increase significantly as well. This would cause the algorithm to converge to an optimal value too quickly and terminate with very few iterations. 
	%\item TODO: what else
\end{enumerate}

%OQNLP: stochastic process that relies on smoothness of function to approximate

\subsection{Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms}

Given the instability of each of these functions over the permutation design variable space, it is natural to solve these MINLP problem using a probabilistic optimization algorithm. For the purposes of this project, the main results were derived using a highly probabilistic genetic algorithm that attempts to explore the permutation design space as much as possible in search for the global optimum values. Genetic algorithms are commonly utilized in the context of cryptography to explore the design space for cryptographic functions. They serve as an intelligence optimization method that can ease the computational efforts of performing brute force searches among the design space, which is crucial for functions with larger domains \cite{Skein}.

Since each of the aformentioned objective functions exhibit the same instable behavior, it is possible to apply the same genetic algorithm structure to solve each one of these. In particular, the genetic algorithm configuration for each of these problems used the following parameters.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Genetic algorithm configuration parameters.}

        \hline

        Generations & $500$ \\ 
        Tolerance Function limit & $1 \times 10^{-6}$ from last function value change \\ 
        Stall generation limit & $2^{n^n}$ identical function values \\ 
        Initial population & S-box configuration $\langle 0, 1, ..., n \rangle$ \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
	\label{configTable}
\end{table}

\section{Genetic Algorithm Optimization Results}
%TODO: compare GA results against exhaustive search and BB algorithm
%1. prsent individual and joint results for order 8 and 16  (3-bit and 4-bit S-boxes)
%2. discuss how close they got to optimal results
%3. discuss usefulness of GA
%4. discuss why BB algorithm didn't work (converged too early and didn't exhaust, too many local minimums for every objective function, GA was good because it generated populations and did psuedo brute force thing)

We now present the optimization results for the three objective functions listed in the Section 2 for $3$- and $4$-bit S-box configurations. Each objective funtion is first optimized individually and then they are joined together as a multi-objective MINLP problem. 

Also, since the genetic algorithm sovler is a probabilistic algorithm that randomizes the population at each generation, it is important to note that each algorithm was run many times to obtain the optimal results. Due to the highly instable objective functions, it is not enough to run the algorithm once and conclude that the results are optimum. 

\subsection{Avalanche Number}

%Calculate average bit flips and see how close each one of these got!

Based on Equation $2$ from Section 1.1, we can easily tell that the optimal value for the avalanche number is exactly $n2^{n-1}$, where $n$ is the number of bits needed to store the S-box values. Therefore, for $3$- and $4$-bit S-boxes, we conclude that the optimal values are $3 \cdot 3(2^2) = 3 \cdot 12 = 36$ and $4 \cdot 4(2^3) = 4 \cdot 32 = 128$, respectively, since we are concerned with the avalanche effect over every single bit. Now, compare these optimal values against those obtained from the optimization algorithm. Table \ref{avTable} contains the optimal results for a $3$-bit S-box configuration that were collected over a variety of optimization runs, and Figure \ref{av16} contains an illustration of the iteration pattern of the algorithm for a higher order $4$-bit S-box configuration.

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

        6     1     1     2     1     6     6     1 & 30 & 63 \\

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on these results we can see that the genetic algorithm was able to reach an optimal value of $30$, which is approximately $16\%$ away from the global optimal value of $36$. Given the time complexity difference between the exhaustive search and the genetic algorithm solver, it is clear that this is an acceptable result.

\subsection{Branch Number}

%http://www.iacr.org/archive/fse2006/40470042/40470042.pdf - shows that branch number is maximum if %q+1 (order of field + 1?) Give the equation and then show that this does not produce optimal results.
%\cite{MaxBN}

It has been proven that the maximum branch number for a function $f : \field{F}_2^n \to \field{F}_2^n$ is equal to $n$ \cite{MaxBN}. Therefore, in the case of $3$- and $4$- bit S-boxes, we know that the maximum possible branch numbers are $3$ and $4$, respectively. Given the small permutation design space for the $3$-bit S-boxes, the genetic algorithm solver was able to obtain this optimal value in a small number of instances. The majority of the executions converged to the local optimal value of $2$.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\label{bnTable}
	\caption{Some results from the genetic algorithm solver for the branch number of $3$-bit S-boxes.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        S-Box Configuration & Optimal Function Value & Generations \\ \hline
        3     4     0     7     5     2     6     1 & 3 & 500 \\ 
	3     6     4     1     5     0     2     7 & 3 & 500 \\ 
        4     7     6     1     2     1     5     6 & 2 & 500 \\ 
        5     3     1     5     6     5     0     7 & 2 & 500 \\

        6     3     4     1     5     6     0     4 & 2 & 500 \\ 
        3     1     5     4     2     6     4     1 & 2 & 500 \\ 
        6     5     5     4     4     3     2     6 & 2 & 500 \\ 
        2     6     6     2     4     3     2     1 & 2 & 500 \\ 
        4     3     1     2     6     7     5     6 & 2 & 500 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Extending the order of the S-box to $4$ bits made the solver even less effective at finding the optimal value of $4$. As shown in Figure \ref{bn16}, although each generation covered a large area of the state space (as indicated by the average bit-wise distance between parents and children), the optimal value still converged to the local optimum of $2$ even after $500$ generations. In fact, there was no execution of the solver that yielded a higher value for the branch number. This is an obvious result due to the instability of the branch number function over the permutation state space. Since there are so many local optimal values for the function that increases with the order of the S-box, the solver simply converges to the nearest optimal and then orbits around that value for each of the following generations. 

Based on these results we conclude that the usage of a genetic algorithm is not particularly helpful when optimizing the branch number of S-boxes.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/bn_results16.eps} \\
	\label{bn16}
\caption{A single evolution of the optimal solution to the branch number of a $4$-bit S-box configuration with a maximum of $500$ generations.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Degree of Nonlinearity}
It has been shown that the most optimal value for $P_S$ is $1$, meaning that the S-box is "perfectly nonlinear" \cite{ProvableSecurity}. However, almost-perfect nonlinear (APN) S-boxes have also been studied extensively and are shown to be almost equally resistent to the most sophisticated differential cryptanalysis attacks, where APN S-boxes have a $P_S$ equal to exactly $2$. Therefore, as shown in Table \ref{nlTable}, the optimization algorithm was able to find a variety of S-box configurations qualify them as APN, which is an indication that the S-box is secure against common attacks. Unfortunately, the solver was not able to find a configuration that yielded the perfectly nonlinear configuation value of $P_S = 1$. 

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Some results from the genetic algorithm solver for the degree of nonlinearity of $3$-bit S-boxes.}
	\label{nlTable}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        S-Box Configuration & Optimal Function Value & Generations Produced \\ \hline
        4     2     1     4     1     1     5     4 & 2 & 51 \\ 
        6     3     6     5     1     5     5     1 & 2 & 51 \\ 
        0     3     3     6     7     6     2     2 & 2 & 51 \\

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Extending the order of the S-box to 16 elements and running the same test yielded the same APN results, as shown in Figure \ref{nl16}. Therefore, we can conclude that the genetic algorithm is very well suited to finding the S-box configuration that achieves an acceptable degree of nonlinearity.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Multi-Objective Optimization}
Based on the fact that cryptographers and mathematicians attempt to optimize all of these measurements together, it is ideal to find an optimal value among all of the objective functions simultaneously. The most common way to solve this is to re-write the optimization problem as a linear combination of all three objective functions. The benefit of this approach is that we can prioritize the influence that each objective function has on the overall solution by assigning weights to each value in this linear combination. For the purposes of this project, the linear combination shown in Figure \ref{jointProblem} was used to formalize the multi-objective MINLP problem.

\section{Conclusions}
%TODO: GA was most promising - similar to BF approach
%TODO: results were closest to brute force, and presumed to be close to actual values
%TODO: joint computations using GA were ineffective, exhaustive searches would be better, contradicting functions caused too great penalties and little change in design variabes
%TODO:  GA work - tweak crossover and mutation functions, run on large scale hardware/software systems

Based on the results from the individual optimization problems and combination problem, we can conclude that the use of genetic algorithms (or any evolutionary algorithm) have very limited or specialized use in the context of cryptography. Most cryptographic functions (and even measurements of those functions) are truly random as across the function domain, and this seemingly random behavior leads to discontinuous and unstable functions with many local optimal solutions. While this rules our traditional optimization algorithms that rely on the smoothness of functions almost immediately, it still leaves some room for probabilistic evolutionary algorithms. 

However, as was shown, the application of such evolutionary algorithms is only moderately useful when optimizing a single dimension (or measurement) of crypgoraphic algorithms; it is not effective when optimizing multiple dimensions at once. The reason for this is that when superimposing each of these functions on top of one another, we are left with a great deal of destructive interference. That is, the global optimal values rarely align for multiple measurement functions for cryptographic algorithms. 

Since cryptographers seek to optimize multiple dimensions at once, the application of such optimization algorithms is likely yield little or no significant benefits to the designers. This conclusion supports the lack of research done in this problem in the field of cryptography. However, that is not to say that the application of all evolutionary algorithms should be ruled out altogether. Perhaps as researchers further refine the security measurements for symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms we may be able to define a multi-objective MINLP that can be optimized to find an optimal configuration for S-boxes. However, until that time, we are left with intuitive and mathematical derivations for S-box configurations.
